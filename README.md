##TicTacToe That Can't Be Beat i.e MiniMax With AB Pruning
==========================================================

Implementation of miniMax. Of all the algorithms I studied this last month
and reviewed, this one missed me. I tell you, I get it now...

I don''t know if this shows my skills, its hard to re-invent the wheel here
and any code I write looks like someone elses, lol. My first tries with the 
minmax didnt go to well, but I love a challenge and this one was that.

My favorite part of this whole adventure is that is pertains to my studies
with machine learning and AI. Very cool.
